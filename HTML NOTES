FORM TAGS:-
<form action = "">
# By using the <form> tag only nothing will be displayed. But when we write,
<form>
<input >
</form>
Then a box will be displayed in the output.

LABLE TAG:-
<label for = "name">First Name</label><br>
The attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> tag to bind them together.

INPUT TAGS:-
<input placeholder ="" type = "" name ="" required id="" value="">
# placeholder = the name which is seen inside the box and the label is usedfor leabelling the box.
# type will define the type of the input value and the validation too. For example,
<input type="email"> will validate the text only with @ symbol.
# You should always giev the type value for the inputs else all the inputs will be given "text" value as default.
# required will validate that the input box is filled with the values.
# type = "text" for text, "radio" for radio button(sleecting one of many choices), "checkbox" for checkbox(selecting zero or more options), "submit" for submit button, "button" for clickable button.
# type = "date, time, range for selecting range, password"
# name implies the place where it is to be stored in the backend. This field is mandatory for backend based storing.  For example,
<input placeholder ="First Name" type = "text" name ="Fname" required>

RADIO BUTTON:-
In case of Radio Button, it is used for selecting only one option. Hence the name field should be the same in every <input> tag else we'll be able to select all the available options.
<input type="radio" name="tech" value="html" id="html_id">
<label for="html_id">HTML</label>
<input type="radio" name="tech">
<label>CSS</label>
<input type="radio" name="tech">
<label>JS</label>
Now you'll be able to select anyone of them, if you don't add the name field then you can select all of them.

CHECKBOX BUTTON:-
For checkbox button you can write different names for the name field.
<input type="text" name="tech1" id="tech_id">
